Weight Training is an open-source iOS mobile app designed for creating and tracking your own personal weight training regimen. You can create 'stations' for each exercise-machine (or exercise). For each 'station', you record the sets, reps, and weights used. The design of the Weight Training Tracker App is to be simple and easy to use.

Please [create a Github Issue](https://github.com/rdegraci/weight-training/issues/new) or [chat with us on Gitter](https://gitter.im/weight-training) if you have any questions or encounter problems while building or running the Weight Training Tracker App.
